BlinkStickDotNet
----------------

[BlinkStick](www.blinkstick.com) is a USB-controlled smart pixel. It is
available either as a kit or ready-soldered.

This is a .NET API for working with a BlinkStick.
Other API's are available in a [variety of programming
languages](http://www.blinkstick.com/help/api-implementations).

There are three main sections:
* BlinkStickDotNet -- an assembly (DLL) for communicating with your BlinkStick
* BlinkStickDotNetTest -- unit tests for the assembly
* BlinkStick -- a console application for controlling your BlinkStick

(If you just want the executable, you can get it from the Downloads section.)

Some features of the BlinkStickDotNet API are as follows:
* Asynchronous blinking (a timer is created automatically to turn the LED off
again at the end of the blink)
* Brightness limit
* Morse code
* CPU monitor
* Memory monitor
* Mouse-over colour changer
